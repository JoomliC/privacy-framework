COM_PRIVACY_CORE_CAPABILITY_LOGGING_IP_ADDRESS="Joomla's logging system records the IP address of the visitor which led to a message being written to its log files. These log files are used to record various activity on a Joomla site, including information related to core updates, invalid login attempts, unhandled errors, and development information such as the use of deprecated APIs. The format of these log files may be customised by any extension which configures a logger, therefore you are encouraged to download and review the log files for your website which may be found at `%s`."
COM_PRIVACY_CORE_CAPABILITY_SESSION_IP_ADDRESS_AND_COOKIE="All requests to a Joomla website start a session which stores the IP address in the session data and creates a session cookie in the user's browser. The IP address is used as a security measure to help protect against potential session hijacking attacks and this information is deleted once the session has expired and its data purged. The session cookie is destroyed once the session has expired or the user has exited their browser."
